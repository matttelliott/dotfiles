Hi, LinkedIn!

I'm currently working a 1-year contract-to-hire gig until this coming May. I'm planning on finishing this contract and putting myself in a position to re-negotiate at the end. I'm on LinkedIn trying to expand my network and exploring what opportunities might be available around May 2023.

I consider myself a Software Architect specializing in front end web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS), Including Browser, Smart TV, Hybrid Native, Server/Client/Statically rendered apps, and anything that can run TypeScript.

I also specialize in the Video Streaming space, with experience with HLS.js (Http Live Streaming) and MPEG-DASH Live and On-Demand Video streaming apps, including paywalls, advertisements, and analytics.

I'm currently making roughly $140k/year, and naturally I would expect to be at or above that level as I progress in my career.

Thanks for reaching out! let me know what you think!
- Matt
